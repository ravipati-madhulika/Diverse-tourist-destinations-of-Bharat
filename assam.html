        <p style="margin:15px;">Majuli is the biggest river island in the world which is located on the Brahmaputra River in the state of Assam. 
            This island is formed by the River Subansiri in the north and River Brahmaputra in the south. It has been known as the cultural
             capital of Assam ever since the 16th century. The main village of the Majuli Isand is Naghmar where many events and festivals are 
             being held even today. This place being pollution free and covered by greenery on all sides is an environment-friendly destination.
              The festivals celebrated here are very colorful and vibrant which is the prime cause for which tourists from different parts of the
               country travel to this location. Raas Purnima is one such important event which people celebrate here in a grand manner. It is
                lovely to see the dance performance which is being organized on this day based on the life of Lord Krishna. The Paal Naam and
                 Bathow Puja are the other notable festivals of Majuli. The destination has 22 Vaishnava Satras which were established during the 
                 15th century. </p>
