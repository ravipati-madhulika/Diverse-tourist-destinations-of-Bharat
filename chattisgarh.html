A white cascade, this is one of Jagdalpur’s important attractions. The falls is also well known as ‘The Milky Falls’ due to its appearance. Tirathgarh waterfall drops down to form a pool at the bottom which is perfect for swimming, paddle boating and bathing. Best enjoyed during the monsoon season when the water gushes down at a fast pace, Tirathgarh is also tranquil and beautiful rest of the year. The bank of the pool has a small shrine of Lord Shiva where locals pray. Around 400 mossy steps will lead you to this bathing pool of the falls, surrounded by dense forests. Be it summer, winter or monsoon, be it, locals or tourists, Tirathgarh is a perfect picnic spot if you’re near Jagdalpur. </p>
