        <p style="margin:15px;">Located on the Parasnath Hill, the highest mountain in the state of Jharkhand, in an inland part of rural east 
            India, of the Giridih district of Jharkhand, Shikharji is one of the holiest pilgrimage sites for Jains. It is believed that here is
             where twenty of the twenty-four Jain Tirthankaras had attained moksha (in other words, freedom from the cycle of rebirth), along with
              several other monks which makes it one of the most important and holy sites for Jain Tirthas. Shikharji rises to a height of 1,350 m 
              thus making it the highest mountain in the state.</p>

            <p style="margin:15px;">Falling in the Latehar district of Jharkhand, Netarhat is the highest point of Chotanagpur plateau, popularly
                 known as Queen of Chotanagpur. It is best known for the sunrise and sunset views it offers, especially during summers. When
                  travelling by road from Ranchi to Netarhat, you will cross seven hills on your way and a little more than 96 miles. Netarhat
                   comes under the tag of lesser-known tourist places. Netarhat is around 156 km to the west of Ranchi and 210 km from Daltonganj.
                    It is also notable for the renowned Netarhat Residential School which was started in the year 1954. Essentials like medicines 
                    are a must-carry as there is a low probability of chemist shops being present nearby.

                <h3>Best Time to visit: During the spring and early summer months. However, surrounded by beautiful highlands of Chotanagpur and 
                    pristine waterfalls, Netrahat is an all-year-round destination for a quick weekend retreat.</h3>
