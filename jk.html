        <p style="margin:15px;">The valley’s remoteness and isolation compound this beauty. This is a side of Kashmir that even most 
            Kashmiris haven’t seen. What makes getting into Warwan Valley even more remarkable is the crossover trail. It begins in 
            Trans-Himalayan settings, among barren, purplish mountains around Panikhar. The trail goes through an oasis, river deltas, 
            wildflower meadows, and glaciers – all among these stark mountains. It makes for hauntingly beautiful settings. As the trail
             slowly moves into the luxuriant greenery of Kashmir, after days of being surrounded by desert mountains, the effect of it is 
             striking.During the crossover, you experience what we believe is Kashmir’s greatest adventure. It is a great adventure because — 
             outside the astounding beauty, there’s a lot of thrill on the trek. The pass day almost feels endless — it has a tricky climb 
             up to the pass. And then it is followed by a 2 km long walk on the magnificent Bracken glacier, navigating its crevasses, right
              up to its snout when it pours over in moraines. The high adventure on this trail makes getting into the glorious greenery of
               Warwan Valley a gift, after long, hard days of trekking.</p>

            <p style="margin:15px;">Nathatop is a short trek away from Patnitop 2 kms away from Jammu. The hill station is covered with 
                snow during winters thereby enhancing its beauty. Nathatop is a famous for paragliding and skiing activities that has been
                 becoming popular over the years. The hill station has a variety of roadside food stalls selling local cuisine. It also embraces
                a pleasant weather throughout the year.One gets an excellent and clear view of the Himalayas from the peak of these hills. 
                It has an altitude of about 2711m. Nestled away from the fast paced cities, it is a must-visit for the nature lovers and 
                for those seeking serenity. Pir Panjal Mountains, when visited during winters, are filled with snow all over and are a 
                treat for the eyes! Snow is replaced by lush green grass in summers.
