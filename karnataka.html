        <p style="margin:15px;">The Kudremukh (literally meaning Horse Face) Range gets its name from the unique shape of its main peak. The broad hills overlook the Arabian Sea and are chained to one another by deep valleys and steep precipices. It is believed that Kudremukh served as a landmark for sailors on the western coast for over 2000 years. As yet ‘undiscovered’ by tourists, Kudremukh is a trekker’s paradise, apart from the main trek to Kuduremukha Peak, other trekking trails are Kurinjal Peak, Gangadikal Peak, Seethabumi Peak, Valikunda, and Narasimha Parvatha. Let the wonderland of lush green forests interspersed with rivers, grassy slopes, captivating cascades, caves, and ruins amaze you as you trek your way through it. The best time to visit is after the monsoon when everything is lush green and the rivers, streams, and waterfalls like Kadambi waterfalls, Hanuman Gundi Falls are at their best. Ganga Moola is a scenic place located in the Bhagawathi forest where the three rivers Tunga, Bhadra, and Netravati originate. A shrine to Goddess Bhagavathi and a 1.8m high Varaha image inside a cave are the chief attractions here.</p>
