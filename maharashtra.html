            <p style="margin:15px;">The Global Vipassana Pagoda is a notable monument in Mumbai, India which serves for peace and harmony.
                 The monument was inaugurated by Pratibha Patil, President of India on 8th February 2009. It is located in the North of Mumbai 
                 on a peninsula between Gorai Creek and the Arabian Sea. The Global Vipassana Pagoda was built out of gratitude to the Buddha, 
                 his teaching and the community of monks practicing his teaching.
                 Its traditional Burmese design is an expression of gratitude towards the country of Myanmar for preserving the practice of
                  Vipassana. The shape of the pagoda is a copy of the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, Myanmar. But the Shwedagon Pagoda is made of 
                  solid masonry whereas the Global Vipassana Pagoda is hollow with an exceptional dome to welcome meditators. It was built combining
                   ancient Indian and modern technology to ensure it lasting for a thousand years.</p>
