            distance of 29 km away from the city of Aizawl, Reiek Tlang is an excellent viewpoint overlooking panoramic views of Aizawl and the
             surrounding valley with the backdrop of sceneries borrowed from the Mizo Hills. The journey to the peak is also an excellent trekking
              opportunity usually reserved for calm sunny days. As is the case with most North Eastern destination of India, the peak of Reiek is
               also relatively unexplored and sits pretty as a pearl in the hills.The Reiek Hills are also home to a tiny village inhabited by
                Mizos which is considered to be a heritage site. Apart from sightseeing, the hill is also a haven for birdwatchers. While climbing 
                up the hill one will come across nests and chirping of the native birds including the Peregrine Falcon which is known to make nests
                 at the rocky edges.</p>
