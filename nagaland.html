        <p style="margin:15px;">The Japfu Peak is one of the most important tourist attractions in Nagaland and is part of the landscape, which has given Nagaland the name ‘Switzerland of the East’. It is one of the most important places to visit near Kohima and over the years the Japfu Peak has become one of the popular tourism spots in the entire North East. Standing tall at 3084 meters, this peak is located 25 kilometers from Kohima. Being the second highest peak in Nagaland, it provides a beautiful view of the Dzukou Valley that is affluent with lush green and thick vegetation, which offers one of the most mesmerizing treks with the backdrop of snow- clad Himalayas. The valley is considered to be the ‘Valley of flowers’ in the North East and is visited mostly during the full bloom and is considered to be the base of the crater of an old volcano.</p>
