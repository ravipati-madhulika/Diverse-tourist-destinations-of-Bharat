        <p style="margin:15px;">One of the most beautiful, pristine lakes in Sikkim, Gurudongmar lake sits in close proximity to the 
            Tibetan and Chinese border in the north. Nested amidst the mountains at 5,183 meters, the freezing alpine lake is amongst
             the major sources of the river Teesta. The lake takes its name after the eminent guru Padmasambhava, who is believed to have
              traversed this region during his visit to Tibet.At an elevation of 17000 ft, Gurudongmar Lake is probably the most
               astounding lake on the planet. It lies in the North side of the Khangchengyao Range and is enclosed all around by 
               snow-secured mountains, the holy lake solidifies during the winters with the exception of at one spot, which the ardent
                conviction has been particularly honoured. The Chinese Tibetan fringe is only a couple of kilometres from the lake. The
                 flavoured water of the lake is accepted to have the wonderful intensity of giving kids to issueless couples. Strangely,
                  the fantasy of Gurudongmar Lake is accepted as respectfully by the Hindus as by the nearby Buddhists. The name Gurudongmar
                   is gotten from the name of the Guru Padmasambhava who is thought to have visited Tibet through this zone. The region is
                    said to be honoured by Guru Padmasambhava. There is a sanctuary of the Guru other than the lake. Lover sightseers just
                     as the army staff offer supplication at the sanctuary.</p>
