        <p style="margin:15px;">70km away from Agra, Bateshwar is essentially a temple town, situated on the bank of the holy river Yamuna. 
            The name Bateshwar appears to have been derived from Vateshwarnathji, one of the many names of Lord Shiva who is the presiding deity
             of this pilgrim town. Flanked by the holy Yamuna, Bateshwar has a plethora of temples, once totaling to 101. Out of these, 42 temples
              still stand here. The beauty of this pilgrim town is its long line of Ghats dotted with a series of temples. Some of the templesâ€™ 
              ceilings still retain their beautiful original frescos painted with traditional vegetable paints. The pilgrim town finds references
               in old scriptures like Ramayan, Mahabharat, Matsya Puran etc. From 8th century to 17th century, it remained an important town under
                the Gurjar, Chandela and Bhadawar kings. The illustrious King Badan Singh of Bhadawar dynasty shifted his capital from Mai to
                 Bateshwar about 400 years ago. The present temples are said to be constructed by him.The Jain scriptures too contain description
                  of Bateshwar. According to legends, the 22nd Tirthankar, Lord Neminathji, was born at the place called Sauripura just 3 km.
                   from Bateshwar. Presently, there are several beautiful Jain temples here.Bateshwar is also famous for its annual Cattle Fair,
                    which is now almost four centuries old. It is held today also between Bateshwar and Mai, at the same site which was earmarked
                     by King Badan Singh for the fair. It is the biggest and the most spectacular Cattle Fair of northern India.</p>

            <p style="margin:15px;">An ancient city connected with Buddha for scores of reasons, Sravasti is one of the major destinations of
                 interest for Buddhists. There are many old structures and relics of Gautam Buddha's hut at Jetavana Monastery that one can
                  explore on their tour to Sravasti. The traveler's appeals in Sravasti chiefly exhibit the association of Lord Buddha to it. 
                  Moreover, tourists can scout Buddhist monks in here meditating under Bodhi tree at different monasteries. Oodles of monasteries 
                  from different nations have been constructed here and some of the countries are South Korea, Tibet and Thailand. Being a small
                   town in the state of Uttar Pradesh, thousands of folks pay a visit to this place from all across the world.
